CVD and cancer are now the leading causes in 127 countries, with CVD leading in 70 countries (including Brazil and India) and cancer leading in 57 countries (including China). Such observations can be seen as part of a late phase of an epidemiologic transition, taking place in the second half of the 20th century and the first half of the present one, in which the dominance of infectious diseases is progressively superseded by noncommunicable diseases. According to present ranks and recent trends, cancer may surpass CVD as the leading cause of premature death in most countries over the course of this century. Clearly, governments must factor in these transitions in developing cancer policies for the local disease profile.           ,              Cardiovascular disease and cancer are now the leading causes of premature death in the majority of countries worldwide, and cancer is likely to surpass cardiovascular disease as the leading causes of death at ages 30‐70 in most countries over the course of this century. Governments must factor in these transitions in formulating and implementing their cancer and noncommunicable disease plans and tailor cost‐effective measures to the local disease profile.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cancer incidence is rising in low- and especially middle-income countries (MIC), driven primarily by four high-burden cancers (breast, cervix, lung, colorectal). By 2030, more than two-thirds of all cancer deaths will occur in MICs. Prevention and early detection are required alongside efforts to improve access to cancer treatment. Successful strategies for decreasing cancer mortality in high-income countries are not always effective, feasible or affordable in other countries. In this review, we evaluate strategies for prevention and early detection of breast, cervix, lung, and colorectal cancers, focusing on modifiable risk factors and high-risk subpopulations. Tobacco taxation, human papilloma virus vaccination, cervical cancer screen-and-treat strategies, and efforts to reduce patient and health system–related delays in the early detection of breast and colorectal cancer represent the highest yield strategies for advancing cancer control in many MICs. An initial focus on high-risk populations is appropriate, with increasing population coverage as resources allow. These strategies can deliver significant cancer mortality gains, and serve as a foundation from which countries can develop comprehensive cancer control programs. Investment in national cancer surveillance infrastructure is needed; the absence of national cancer data to identify at-risk groups remains a barrier to the development of context-specific cancer control strategies.},

  abstract = {Since its discovery in the early 1990s, functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to study human brain function. One well-established application of fMRI in the clinical setting is the neurosurgical planning of patients with brain tumors near eloquent cortical areas. Clinical fMRI aims to preoperatively identify eloquent cortices that serve essential functions in daily life, such as hand movement and language. The primary goal of neurosurgery is to maximize tumor resection while sparing eloquent cortices adjacent to the tumor. When a lesion presents in the vicinity of an eloquent cortex, surgeons may use fMRI to plan their best surgical approach by determining the proximity of the lesion to regions of activation, providing guidance for awake brain surgery and intraoperative brain mapping. The acquisition of fMRI requires patient preparation prior to imaging, determination of functional paradigms, monitoring of patient performance, and both processing and analysis of images. Interpretation of fMRI maps requires a strong understanding of functional neuroanatomy and familiarity with the technical limitations frequently present in brain tumor imaging, including neurovascular uncoupling, patient compliance, and data analysis. This review discusses clinical fMRI in neuro-oncology, relevant ongoing research topics, and prospective future developments in this exciting discipline. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Accurate segmentation of stroke lesions on MRI images is very important for neurologists in the planning of post-stroke care. Segmentation helps clinicians to better diagnose and evaluation of any treatment risks. However, manual segmentation of brain lesions relies on the experience of neurologists and is also a very tedious and time-consuming process. So, in this study, we proposed a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN-Res) that automatically performs the segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions from multimodal MRIs.                                         Methods               CNN-Res used a U-shaped structure, so the network has encryption and decryption paths. The residual units are embedded in the encoder path. In this model, to reduce gradient descent, the residual units were used, and to extract more complex information in images, multimodal MRI data were applied. In the link between the encryption and decryption subnets, the bottleneck strategy was used, which reduced the number of parameters and training time compared to similar research.                                         Results               CNN-Res was evaluated on two distinct datasets. First, it was examined on a dataset collected from the Neuroscience Center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, where the average Dice coefficient was equal to 85.43\%. Then, to compare the efficiency and performance of the model with other similar works, CNN-Res was evaluated on the popular SPES 2015 competition dataset where the average Dice coefficient was 79.23\%.                                         Conclusion               This study presented a new and accurate method for the segmentation of MRI medical images using a deep convolutional neural network called CNN-Res, which directly predicts segment maps from raw input pixels.},

  abstract = {As an emerging biomedical image processing technology, medical image segmentation has made great contributions to sustainable medical care. Now it has become an important research direction in the field of computer vision. With the rapid development of deep learning, medical image processing based on deep convolutional neural networks has become a research hotspot. This paper focuses on the research of medical image segmentation based on deep learning. First, the basic ideas and characteristics of medical image segmentation based on deep learning are introduced. By explaining its research status and summarizing the three main methods of medical image segmentation and their own limitations, the future development direction is expanded. Based on the discussion of different pathological tissues and organs, the specificity between them and their classic segmentation algorithms are summarized. Despite the great achievements of medical image segmentation in recent years, medical image segmentation based on deep learning has still encountered difficulties in research. For example, the segmentation accuracy is not high, the number of medical images in the data set is small and the resolution is low. The inaccurate segmentation results are unable to meet the actual clinical requirements. Aiming at the above problems, a comprehensive review of current medical image segmentation methods based on deep learning is provided to help researchers solve existing problems.},

Analysing the AI-based devices that have already obtained the official approval by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), here we show that cancer diagnostics is the oncology-related area in which AI is already entered with the largest impact into clinical practice. Furthermore, breast, lung and prostate cancers represent the specific cancer types that now are experiencing more advantages from AI-based devices. The future perspectives of AI in oncology are discussed: the creation of multidisciplinary platforms, the comprehension of the importance of all neoplasms, including rare tumours and the continuous support for guaranteeing its growth represent in this time the most important challenges for finalising the ‘AI-revolution’ in oncology.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel attention gate (AG) model for medical imaging that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules of cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN architectures such as the U-Net model with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed Attention U-Net architecture is evaluated on two large CT abdominal datasets for multi-class image segmentation. Experimental results show that AGs consistently improve the prediction performance of U-Net across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency. The code for the proposed architecture is publicly available.},

  abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},
